## üóÇÔ∏è Simplified TopoJSON Version

A simplified version of the `FSA_Counties_dd17` dataset is included in this repository as `fsa-counties-dd17.topojson`. This version was created to reduce geometric complexity and ensure compatibility with common web mapping tools.

### üîß Processing Steps

The GeoJSON file was generated using the R `sf`, `tigris`, and `rmapshaper` packages, along with command line topojson tools. The following steps were performed:

1. **Ingest and normalize FSA county definitions**  
   - Reads the zipped File Geodatabase (`/vsizip/FSA_Counties_dd17.gdb.zip`).  
   - Round‚Äëtrips through a temporary GeoJSON to flatten any curved geometries.  
   - Ensures all geometries are valid.

2. **Project, clip and simplify**  
   - Reprojects to Conus Albers (EPSG:5070).  
   - Clips to the union of all U.S. counties (dropping out‚Äëof‚Äëbounds pieces).  
   - Simplifies topology with Mapshaper, repairs any invalid geometries, then reprojects back to WGS84 (EPSG:4326).

3. **Dissolve and filter**  
   - Excludes non‚Äëcontiguous U.S. territories (American Samoa, Guam, etc.).  
   - Keeps only the `FSA_STCOU` field (renamed to `id`).  
   - Dissolves by `id` so each FSA code is a single polygon.

4. **Export GeoJSON files**  
   - Writes **fsa‚Äëcounties‚Äëdd17.geojson** (raw geographic layout).  
   - Applies `tigris::shift_geometry()` to inset Alaska/Hawaii, then writes **fsa‚Äëcounties‚Äëdd17‚Äëalbers.geojson**.

5. **Inline TopoJSON conversion & cleanup**  
   Inside a single `system()` call, the script:
   - **Defines** a shell function `geojson_to_topojson()` that:
     1. Derives base names: strips `.geojson` to get `<base>`, sets `<base>.ndjson` and `<base>.topojson`.  
     2. **Converts GeoJSON ‚Üí NDJSON** via `geojson2ndjson` + `ndjson-map` (extracting each feature‚Äôs `id`).  
     3. **Builds TopoJSON** with `geo2topo`, `toposimplify`, and two `topomerge` steps (first into states, then nation).  
     4. **Removes** the original `.geojson` and intermediate `.ndjson`.  
   - **Invokes** `geojson_to_topojson` on both `fsa-counties-dd17.geojson` and `fsa-counties-dd17-albers.geojson`.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use

1.  Unzip the `FSA_Counties_dd17.gdb.zip` file.
2.  Open the `.gdb` in a GIS software environment such as [QGIS](https://qgis.org) or [ArcGIS Pro](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-pro/overview).
3.  Use the layer properties to explore attributes and spatial coverage.

## üìå Background

The dataset originates from the **dd17** schema, a legacy geospatial data standard used by the USDA Farm Service Agency (FSA) for structuring county-level datasets. It served as a spatial index for county-level geospatial products and was used in conjunction with the **Common Land Unit (CLU)** framework.

While the dataset may no longer be updated or actively distributed by the USDA, it remains of historical and analytical interest ‚Äî particularly for referencing USDA program boundaries, disaster assistance eligibility, and other geospatial analysis across agriculture and conservation.
